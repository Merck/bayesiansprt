# bayesiansprt

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `bayesiansprt` (under GPL-3 licence) is to provide the results for sequential probability ratio test under frequentist and Bayesian setup.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `bayesiansprt` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("bayesiansprt")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bayesiansprt)
## basic example code
method = "Bayes"
n.sim = 10000
n.event = 60
n.start = 30
n.increment = 5
ve.null = 0.3
ve.alt = 0.75
type1 = 0.025
power = 0.9
ratio.alloc = 1
optimum.w = TRUE
b.prior = 1
seed = 134

opt.w = SPRToptimumW(n.sim = n.sim, n.event = n.event, n.start = n.start,
                     n.increment = 5, ve.null = ve.null, ve.alt = ve.alt,
                     type1 = type1, power = power, ratio.alloc = ratio.alloc,
                     w = seq(0.8, 0.9, by = 0.1), b.prior = b.prior, seed = seed)

results = outputSPRT(method = method, n.sim = n.sim, n.event = n.event, n.start = n.start,
                    n.increment = n.increment, ve.null = ve.null, ve.alt = ve.alt,
                    type1 = type1, power = power, ratio.alloc = ratio.alloc,
                    optimum.w = optimum.w, w = opt.w$weight, b.prior = b.prior, seed = seed)
results

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
